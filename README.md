# Streaming-Graph
This repository contains the graph data model of a streaming platform, representing core domain entities such as Users, Movies, Series, Actors, Directors, and Genres.
The purpose of this model is to enable rich querying, analytics, and recommendation use-cases using graph technology—particularly Neo4j.

## 📌 Conceptual Model

The graph is composed of the following nodes and relationships:

### 🧩 Nodes
